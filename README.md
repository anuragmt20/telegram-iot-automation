Telegram IoT Device Automation
Control IoT devices through Telegram using MQTT and Pipedream. This project enables remote control of ESP32-based devices from anywhere in the world using simple Telegram commands.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
text
User → Telegram Bot → Pipedream Workflow → HiveMQ Broker → ESP32 Device → Physical Output
User sends command to Telegram bot (e.g., /led on)

Telegram forwards the message to Pipedream via webhook

Pipedream processes the command and publishes to HiveMQ

HiveMQ broker distributes the message to subscribed devices

ESP32 receives the MQTT message and controls connected devices

Confirmation is sent back to user via Telegram

⚡ Quick Start
1. Create a Telegram Bot
Open Telegram and search for @BotFather

Send /newbot command and follow instructions

Save the API token provided

Note your bot's username

2. Set Up HiveMQ Cloud Broker
Sign up at HiveMQ Cloud

Create a new cluster (free plan)

Note your cluster credentials

3. Configure Pipedream Workflow
Sign up at Pipedream

Create a new workflow with HTTP/Webhook trigger

Set up the workflow steps as detailed in /docs/pipedream_setup.md

4. Flash ESP32 Device
Use the code from /src/esp32/telegram_iot_control.ino

Replace placeholder values with your credentials

Upload to your ESP32 device

🚀 Usage
Send these commands to your Telegram bot:

/start - Show welcome message

/help - Show help information

/led on - Turn on the LED

/led off - Turn off the LED

🔧 Extending the Project
This architecture can control:

Multiple LEDs or lights

Relays for appliances

Sensors (temperature, humidity)

Motors and actuators

Home automation systems

📋 Prerequisites
